After taking ICS 314 (Software Engineering I) here at UH, I grew an appreciation for software engineering and web design, and I have wanted to prioritize building those skills throughout my degree. For this reason, I was very excited to take 414 (Software Engineering II) and had high expectations for myself and my group. I saw this class format as a great opportunity to both strengthen my skillset in a field of ICS I was particularly interested in and improve my collaboration skills while working within a large group. During the initial few weeks of the course, I felt a good connection with my groupmates and thought that we would be a focused group who wanted to work hard to showcase our skills and effort in a large cumulative project.

Unfortunately, my personal circumstances changed throughout the course of the semester, which prevented me from dedicating as much time to this project as I had hoped. Due to personal challenges and some financial difficulties, I began working full-time as both a way to bolster my resume as I come to an end of my degree, as well as earn much needed money to support myself financially. Particularly towards the end of the semester, I felt at times I had to set aside my schoolwork and focus on other external pressures. I felt torn between my school and life obligations, and this significantly reduced the amount of time I could spend on homework, code reviews, overall contribution to my projects, and studying. 

Reflecting on our group as a whole, I felt as though we underperformed. Although I feel as though I personally let my group down by not contributing enough, I am aware that a few other members of my group also struggled to manage their time effectively for this course. With that said, I do think we did some things well. We were able to build an app that effectively displays forecasted financial data with dynamic visualizations. We also managed to include quality of life features, and role-dependent permissions throughout the app. 

Despite the challenges my group and I faced working on this project, I still feel as though I personally gained a meaningful experience. The collaboration between Professor Moore and the Spire Organization allowed us to practice software engineering in a “real-world” setting with regular update meetings, feedback on our work directly from our client, and realistic expectations (for students). While I wish I could’ve taken this course during a less hectic time of my life, taking this class still taught me valuable lessons.

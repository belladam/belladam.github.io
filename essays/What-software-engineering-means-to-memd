## What Software Engineering Means to Me

Since I began my journey to become a software engineer, I have found the process of writing code very rewarding. Although there are times where I may be trying to fix an error, and growing frusturated with not being able to solve it, when I finally find the solution and everything works as intended, its very satisfying. In these moments I realized I have a passion for computer science, programming, and software engineering. Even though the projects I have completed are relatively small, after completeting them I felt really happy. I think as I continue my career path and take on larger and larger projects, this gratifying feeling will only become greater.

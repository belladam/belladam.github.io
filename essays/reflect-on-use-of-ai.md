### I. Introduction
It's clear that the introduction of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc. has completely transformed the educational experience. It is now possible to have an entire essay written for you in less than a minute. On top of this, AI can help with math, writing code, and almost anything else you can think of. I found AI to be very useful when breaking down small parts of a larger issue I was trying to solve.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
When working on the Experience WODs, I did not use AI often, if at all. We were provided thorough guides and documentation that helped me work through the assignments and learn the new material. I think AI could have been useful, but I felt comfortable completing the assignments and felt as though I would learn the material better if I avoided using it.
  2. In-class Practice WODs
For the in-class practice WODs, I used AI to help with small tasks like centering an text element, formatting a background image, and other CSS tweaks. I found AI to be very useful in this regard, but less useful when trying to accomplish larger scale tasks like setting up a meteor template.
  3. In-class WODs
I used AI here and there in the in-class WODs. When under a time crunch or when I felt totally stuck with the clock ticking down, I used AI so that I wouldn't take a large hit to my grade. Similar to the practice WODs, I found AI useful for small tasks and the initial JSFiddle WODs that were primarily focused on JavaScript logic e.g. ("Why are my values coming back as undefined when running this block of code: ... ").
  4. Essays
I used AI to maintain proper grammmar and spelling. I did not use AI to assist with my actual writing since most of the essays were expected to be opinionated or personal.
  5. Final project
When working on my final project, I used AI to help with some areas of creating a meteor web application that I did not feel confident / familiar with. An example of this was making sure I had subscribed to any collections I was using with the proper syntax ("What do I need to include in my Mongo.js file to make sure I am properly subscribing to the Projects subscription?". Similar to the practice WODs, I used AI to help format a lot of the CSS work I did.
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
When learning a new concept in class, I felt like the screencasts and experiences were more than adequate for helping me understand new technical skills. I rarely, if ever, used AI for this reason.
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
Many times in class discussions, we were encouraged to consult AI to gain a better conceptual understanding of whatever topic we were learning. I had never experienced this in a class, but I think it was a great way to have all of the 
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
When coming up with smart-questions in this class, I would ask ChatGPT something like "How can I make this question worded to be consise and descriptive enough to get my point across".
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
An example of a question I asked ChatGPT to help me with a coding problem I faced was when I was working with

### I. Introduction
It's clear that the introduction of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc. has completely transformed the educational experience. It is now possible to have an entire essay written for you in less than a minute. On top of this, AI can help with math, writing code, and almost anything else you can think of. I found AI to be very useful when breaking down small parts of a larger issue I was trying to solve.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18   
When working on the Experience WODs, I did not use AI often, if at all. We were provided thorough guides and documentation that helped me work through the assignments and learn the new material. I think AI could have been useful, but I felt comfortable completing the assignments and felt as though I would learn the material better if I avoided using it.
  2. In-class Practice WODs   
For the in-class practice WODs, I used AI to help with small tasks like centering an text element, formatting a background image, and other CSS tweaks. I found AI to be very useful in this regard, but less useful when trying to accomplish larger scale tasks like setting up a meteor template.
  3. In-class WODs   
I used AI here and there in the in-class WODs. When under a time crunch or when I felt totally stuck with the clock ticking down, I used AI so that I wouldn't take a large hit to my grade. Similar to the practice WODs, I found AI useful for small tasks and the initial JSFiddle WODs that were primarily focused on JavaScript logic e.g. ("Why are my values coming back as undefined when running this block of code: ... ").
  4. Essays   
I used AI to maintain proper grammmar and spelling. I did not use AI to assist with my actual writing since most of the essays were expected to be opinionated or personal.
  5. Final project   
When working on my final project, I used AI to help with some areas of creating a meteor web application that I did not feel confident / familiar with. An example of this was making sure I had subscribed to any collections I was using with the proper syntax ("What do I need to include in my Mongo.js file to make sure I am properly subscribing to the Projects subscription?". Similar to the practice WODs, I used AI to help format a lot of the CSS work I did.
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial   
When learning a new concept in class, I felt like the screencasts and experiences were more than adequate for helping me understand new technical skills. I rarely, if ever, used AI for this reason.
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord   
Many times in class discussions, we were encouraged to consult AI to gain a better conceptual understanding of whatever topic we were learning. I had never experienced this in a class, but I think it was a great way to have all of the main bulletpoints presented to us in an easy-to-understand way.
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question   
When coming up with smart-questions in this class, I would ask ChatGPT something like "How can I make this question worded to be consise and descriptive enough to get my point across" to improve the quality of the question I was asking. 
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”   
An example of a question I asked ChatGPT to help me with a coding problem I faced was when I was asked 
  10. Explaining code   
I found AI to be helpful for explaining blocks of code that was unfamiliar to me. Especially when learning the underscore methods. I would see an underscore method used with multiple parameters, and ChatGPT was able to clearly outline what each argument was used for and what the method accomplished. 
  11. Writing code   
When writing code, I primarily used AI to help me if I got really stuck or if I had spent too long trying to solve an issue. This was usually for small syntax issues or some logic that I had gotten wrong.
  13. Documenting code   
I did not use AI to document any of my code. I'm sure it could have helped me with this, but I felt like I needed to understand what my code was doing, so I made a point of writing any documentation myself.
  14. Quality assurance   
I rarely used AI to ensure quality in my code. We had other tools at our disposal such as ESLint, testcafe, and manual testing which I used to make sure my code worked properly.
  15. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above   
I cannot think of any times that I used AI to assit me with this class other than the examples provided above.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Incorporating AI into my learning of new topics in this class was overall very helpful. I know that it saved me a lot of trouble when trying to understand new areas of software engineering. It helped me build my skills faster and overall made me a more competent software engineer. I think it is extremely important to analyze how much I utilized AI and how much I was actually learning. I think relying on AI too much would be a recipe for distaster when trying to actually join the workforce in this industry. So it's important to manage it, but I do believe AI can be a very effective tool to enhance one's learning.

### IV. Practical Applications:
The use of AI has practical applications that extend to almost any industry in the modern era. AI can be used for improved medical analysis and interpretation, or analyzing market fluctuations for finanical trading. This highlights not only the strength of some of these AI bots, but also their flexibility. Almsot any business can potentially benefit from the isight of these massive data treasure troves.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
As mentioned in the Impact on Learning section, an overreliance on AI can leave a student unprepared to face real word problems they may face in their career. A lack of general knowledge can leave you passed over for an oportunity, even if you're great at writing prompts to ChatGPT. Additionally, sometimes ChatGPT can write some really poor code. Sometimes it will overcomplicate ways of accomplishing a goal and create unnecessary confusion to a reader. An opportunity for further integration of AI in software engineering educatoin might include personalized learning assitance or tutoring. If AI could read code that you write and recognize common mistakes you make, it could create custom learning modules that would help the programmer learn how to avoid these mistakes they find themselves making frequently.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
When thinking of tradtional learning methods vs AI-assited learning, I tend to think of the parallel conversation of book learning vs school in the age of the internet. When the internet was still young, there was concern that having immediate access to an entire ocean of information would make people lazy, undereducated, and too reliant on external help. I think AI is just an extension of this issue. While it is an incredibly powerful tool and has the potential for abuse (cheating), the future of education needs to embrace the change and find a way to effectively use it. This way, learning will be enhanced and not hindered by the introduction of AI. It's certainly not going anywhere, so finding ways of u

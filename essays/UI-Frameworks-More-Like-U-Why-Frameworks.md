## What are UI Frameworks?

UI Frameworks are pre-defined libraries of stylesheets that you can link to your HTML page and have many different convenient tools at your disposal. Some of these tools include standard spacing (e.g. p-2, p-3, p-4, etc.), color schemes for an entire navbar or footer section, and much, much more. To build a beautiful webpage from scratch requires a tremendous amount of adjustments and tweaking to get things looking right. Utilizing a UI framework takes out a lot of this headache, and makes it much easier to create something professional looking, without the hours spent changing tiny parts of your CSS stylesheet.

## My Thoughts

While the title of this essay may lead you to believe that I do not like UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5, I actually enjoy using them and definitely see their value. It's true, learning how to use a new framework can be challenging and time consuming. However, once you become familiar with a specific framework, it makes any future work you do so much quicker and easier. As someone who hadn't used a UI framework before this past week, I can confirm there is quite a steep learning curve to be able to effectively use the provided tools. I think of UI frameworks as being similar to programming languages in the way that with a bit of commitment, you can do some pretty interesting things with it, but there will always be more to learn and ways to improve your skills.

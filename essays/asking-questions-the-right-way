# Asking Questions The Right Way
StackOverFlow is a great resource for software engineers where if you are stuck with an issue, you can reach out to a forum consisting of thousands of users who are willing to help. It has helped me many times in my journey of learning about programming. With that said, there is a smart way of asking questions which will provide great results consistently, and then there are not-so-smart questions that are downvoted and ridiculed on the forum. In this essay, I will highlight two questions that demonstrate each side of questions on StackOverFlow.

# The Good
When asking a question on StackOverFlow, it is imporant to give the potential responders as much information while also being as clear and consise as possible. As long as the potential responder understands what you are asking and you give them enough information, while also being respectful and following common courtesy, many people will be happy to help. One such example of a question like this I found on StackOverFlow is someone asking "How do I remove a property from a JavaScript object?". This question is consise, it's obvious what the asker wants to accomplish, and someone who is familiar with JavaScript will be able to answer with minimal effort. As well as this, the user provided a small amount of sample code to give the responders a bit of context to help them answer the question.

# The Bad
There are many poorly phrased and obviously not thought-out questions on StackOverFlow, which is to be expected of a large online forum. A prime exapmle of a poor question I found was someone asking "where are the errors am getting?". It is obvious this user did not put a ton of effort into this question if they did not bother to spellcheck their question title. Additionally, the question provides 75 lines of code, and it is riddled with syntax errors. The user also provided all errors they were recieving which was another 75 lines of console output.

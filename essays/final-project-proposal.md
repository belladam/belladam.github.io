# ICS Project Finder for Students and Professors
Adam Bell, Dimitry Gordeev, Brandon Nakata, Gabriel White, Adriel White, and Tim Lum.

## Overview
* The problem: For ICS students at UH Manoa, it can be difficult to find interesting projects that will improve the quality of their professional portfolios, or generally improve their skills as software engineers.
* The solution: A web application that allows professors or fellow students to post project ideas, and allows students to find the ideal project for them.

## Mockup Ideas
The application would ask the user whether they were in search of a project to complete, or if they would like to submit a project of their own. Students searching for a project would be able to fill out a form specifying different categories of projects; e.g. difficulty, programming languages used, estimated time of completion, etc. Anyone submitting a project will also fill out a form with these fields. There will be a search feature with filter options, a rating system taking into account difficulty, and a forum for people to leave comments and ask questions about a project.

## Use Cases
Professors and faculty of UH Manoa would be able to use this application to post assignments in their courses and offer extra credit opportunities to their students. Students of UH Manoa would be able to use it in the reverse mannor, if an assignment has multiple options students would be able to find them here as well as browse any extra credit opportunities for their class. The application has the potential to be expanded to other departments as well.

## Beyond the Basics
If we were successful enough in building this web application, it could be utilized by the ICS department at UH Manoa, and even potentially expanded to other classes and majors within the school. This requires a polished and well built application.

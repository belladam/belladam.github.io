## Why are coding standards imporant?

There are many reasons why coding standards are important to uphold when writing code. Especially when you work in a team, maintaining standards in your code improves readability and makes it much easier for teammates to understand exactly what is going on. This is crucial for collaboration because it allows different people to effectively work on a project without having to spend lots of time before actually doing any work, just to understand what the code is doing. Maintenance or changing segments of code is also much easier when proper standards are present. Proper spacing can prevent an extra parentheses or bracket to be forgotten, meaning new bugs are less likely to happen. 

## Learning the proper way

I think making an effort to understand coding standards and implementing them in every piece of code you write is a great way to learn a new programming language. Beginning a large endeavor like that with good habits will be much easier than having to correct poor habits later. Understanding how to correctly space brackets and parenthesis also helps a new programmer to understand exactly how the functions and declarations etc. actually work. I think it helps to visualize code blocks, and where methods begin and end.

## IntelliJ and ESLint

Recently, I have made the switch from primarily using Visual Studio Code to using IntelliJ. Overall, I like IntelliJ and I think it is very similar to VSCode. I am still getting used to some of the functionality, but the transition in general has been painless. Previously, when I would write most of my code in Java, I used CheckStyle which is also very simliar to ESLint, at least in some aspects.

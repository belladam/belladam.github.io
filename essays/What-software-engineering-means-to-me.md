## What Software Engineering Means to Me

Since I began my journey to become a software engineer, I have found the process of writing code very rewarding. Although there are times where I may be trying to fix an error, and growing frusturated with not being able to solve it, when I finally find the solution and everything works as intended, its very satisfying. In these moments I realized I have a passion for computer science, programming, and software engineering. Even though the projects I have completed are relatively small, after completeting them I felt really happy. I think as I continue my career path and take on larger and larger projects, this gratifying feeling will only become greater. I am very excited to see what kind of projects I will accomplish and where my career will go.

## Skills and Experiences

Some skills I want to develop over the next couple years include improved proficiency in industry-standard programming languages like Javascript, Python, C++, etc. There are many other skills that are necessary to be a successful software engineer such as being able to collaborate effectively, problem solving, and having a good understanding of algorithms and data sciences. I think all of these are very important to succeed in the field of software engineering. As far as experiences I am hoping to have, I would like to focus on some larger-scale projects that really test my skills and knowledge as a software engineer. I am also hoping to work on projects collaboratively with other students to model real-world work experience.

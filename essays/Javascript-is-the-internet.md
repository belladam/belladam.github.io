## Introduction

Javascript is a very fascinating programming language just in the fact that a whopping 98.7% of websites on the internet today utilize Javascript (W3Techs). I had always heard that Javascript was imporant to web development, but I had no idea practically every website is functional thanks to JS. It is difficult to overstate the importanance of Javascript since so many millions of people surf the internet everyday, and this is a big reason as to why I am excited to become proficient in it. Before enrolling in my undergraduate Computer Science degree at University of Hawaii Manoa, I had taken some online programming courses that primarily focused on web development. This gave me some great exposure to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm very glad I did this but now I find myself in a funny place where I had previously learned JS, then learned Java in my first year, and now in my second year I am again using JS.

## My thoughts on Javascript

I like Javascript as a programming language, but this may be because it was one of the first languages I was exposed to, and I don't have too many other languages to compare it to. Perhaps as I continue to learn more languages, my opinion of it will change. It seems intuitive to me, even with some of the shorthand syntax that is not obvious, but once you know it it's easy to remember. I found Javascript to be very similar to Javas, but more nuanced and flexible.

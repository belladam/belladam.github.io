## Javascript and the Internet

Javascript is a very fascinating programming language just in the fact that a whopping 98.7% of websites on the internet today utilize Javascript (W3Techs). I had always heard that Javascript was imporant to web development, but I had no idea practically every website is functional thanks to JS. It is difficult to overstate the importanance of Javascript since so many millions of people surf the internet everyday, and this is a big reason as to why I am excited to become proficient in it. 

## My thoughts on Javascript

I like Javascript as a programming language, but this may be because it was one of the first languages I was exposed to, and I don't have many other languages in my repertoire to compare it to. Perhaps as I continue to learn more languages, my opinion of it will change. Before enrolling in my undergraduate Computer Science degree at University of Hawaii Manoa, I had taken some online programming courses that primarily focused on web development. This gave me some great exposure to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript itself seems intuitive to me, even with some of the shorthand syntax that is not obvious, but once you know it it's easy to remember. I found Javascript to be very similar to Java, but more nuanced and flexible.

## Athletic Software Engineering

I have a love/hate relationship with athletic software engineering and the practice of WODs (Workout Of the Day). On one hand, I find the time limit and 
the concern of losing all credit for a given task very stressful. On the other hand, I think this is great practice for real world technical interviews for software engineers. I know that in due time I will be grateful for having gone through this process, but right now it is challenging.

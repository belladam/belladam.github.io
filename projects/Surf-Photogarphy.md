Having been born and raised here in Hawaii, when I was younger I always loved surfing and the ocean. When I was about 15, I was given a GoPro camera for my birthday. I ended up developing a passion for surf photography, and while I don't do it nearly as often as I used to, I still love it. Here is a small collection of my favorite photos thoughout the years.
